And then I postpone it for a whole month.

And now Ive got a stale, working pi.
Timeskip, today 10/16/2025 I fuharoundwiddittttt
I got a new face for it (the e-girl one because its punky and it reminds me of female v from cyberpunk 2077 (game changed my life)) anyway
I threw some plugins on it like a capitalist fuck disrespectfully throwing 0.05 cents at a homeless man
and BOOM!
